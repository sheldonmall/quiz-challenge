# This is unit 04 Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz

## Website URL

My code quiz website can be found at [My Quiz Challenge](https://sheldonmall.github.io/quiz-challenge/). 

## Installation

There are no specific steps to install this website, nor are there any installable tools on this website, as of now.


## Usage 

This website is for a quiz challenge. The usage of this quiz is described below:

When the page loads, you will see the welcome page with `Click here to start Quiz` button. The page also has a navigation bar at the top which stays consistent even on the quiz page to give user a uniform navigation experience. The navigation bar on the `Home` page has the following buttons:

* Clicking on `Quiz Challenge` will always bring user back to this `Home` page.
* Clicking on the `High Score` button will show the highest score and initials of the person who got the high scores.


You start the quiz by following the steps given below:

* Click on the `Start Quiz` button. After this, you will be taken to the main Quiz page. 
- On this page, navigation bar changes to show another button called `Main Page` will always bring user back to the ` Home` page. 
- You will also see the `Start Quiz` button which has the functionality to launch the quiz.
- After this, a timer countdown starts at the top of the page to show the amount of time remaining to complete the quiz. Total time for the quiz depends on the number of questions in the quiz. Each questions is currently given 15 seconds, but this can be changed in the code.
- At the same time, questions show up one by one with four choices to choose from. Each choice is a `button` that can be clicked to select the correct answer.
- Each incorrect answer reduces the timer by the amount of time allocated to each question.
- The quiz ends when either the user has attempted all questions, or the time has run out.
- Page displays the time remaining as the score for the user. If the score is more than 0, then user is prompted to enter his/her initials and then both fields are stored in local storage.
- Highest score can be viewed by clicking on the `High Score` button in the navigation bar.

## Tests

My website is simple to use. 

The website is not fully working as I am not able to get the code to validate my choice. As a result of that I could not test high scores and retrieve the high scores either.

I will continue to debug the issue to make the code work after this assignment is submitted.
